# minesweeper
This is my first ever c project done in a course at university.

This aims to emulate some features of the classic game minesweeper, and play it 
in a simple UI in a linux shell.

This project was used to implement function structures, different libraries and apply
arrays in a complex context.

Refer to the assignment spec for more information about this game.

## TO NOTE
Not all features of the game could be coded, as it was difficult to implement Subset 4
without the program breaking.
